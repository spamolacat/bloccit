# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development.

made with my mentor Vagmi at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
